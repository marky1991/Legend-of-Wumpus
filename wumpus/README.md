================

To start the server, run server_launcher.py.

To run the client, modify start_client.py to use the correct ip and port, then run it. This is admittedly clunky. Proper
command-line parameters will be provided at a later date. (A full GUI is anticipated later)

Note that the "Game" doesn't actually do anything yet, short of connecting to the server. It's a WIP. : )

Only tested with python 3. (3.3 specifically, but should work  with anything at least 3.2+, and probably 3.0+)
